A rudimentary XR mod for Minecraft using OpenXR and the FabricMC mod loader.

# :warning: Caution

MCXR is in early pre-pre-alpha. We are not accepting PRs and issues will be ignored until the codebase has become semi-stable.

# Installation

Installing the mod requires an understanding of programming in Java and managing natives. If you don't know what that means I recommend waiting until we start releasing alpha builds.<br>
Once built, an OpenXR loader needs to be put in the `mods` folder, windows binaries of which can be retrieved from [here](https://nuget.org/packages/OpenXR.Loader)
