A rudimentary XR mod for Minecraft Fabric using the Fabric and OpenXR API.

# *Installation*
This mod currently relies on prior knowledge of how to use an IDE in order to run. If you are unsure of what you are doing, it's recommended that you wait until the first release of the JAR mod. If you are a developer and would like to test out the current version of Minecraft XR, clone the repo.

## *Pull Requests*
Currently, MCXR is not looking for code change pull requests. If you are making any changes to the code, please be aware that your PR may not be merged.
