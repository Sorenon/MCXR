A rudimentary XR mod for Minecraft using OpenXR and the fabric mod loader.


# âš  Caution
MCXR is in early pre-pre-alpha. We are not accepting PRs and issues will be ignored until the codebase has become semi-stable.

# *Installation*
Installing the mod requires an understanding of programming in Java and managing natives. If you don't know what that means I recommend waiting until we start releasing alpha builds.
</br>
While the mod is in an experimental state JDK 8 is needed to build it (bleeding-edge builds are also [here](https://github.com/Sorenon/MCXR/actions)).
Once built an OpenXR loader is needed, windows binaries of which can be retrieved from [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenXR.Loader/)
